I want to create a agentic system which automatically creates toddler book, starting with a 1 story theme and story context theme (such as rainforest cute animal, mermainds in deep sea, frog in pond, ducks, etc,） (with or without additional inserted real life anecdotes, pictures, or some other requirements for guidance). what is the suggested code design (and preferrably also the code system) for creating the agentic system in order to complete the following steps: (1) create 1 or 2 sentences for 15 pages given the story theme provided by user; (2) according to the story context, generate 15 pages (portrait layout good for EPUB format for pulishing on Apple Ebook book store); (3) put the texts on to each page so that it is easy to read for kids or kids' parents (from iphone, ipad or mac); (4) assemble the pages (with texts attached) together (using Pages or whatever other method) and generate EPUB format of book. (5) Create cover page that can catch eyes of parents or kids from kids book category, inlcude author name as provided. (6) create a second cover page with single background (warm and cute color) with main charater on the right bottom corner of the page, and words such as "Author: {author name}" on the left center. Beneath author line, add "Illustrated by: {author name}, assisted by GenAI". Please implement such an agentic ai system in python, in folder src . Also suggest if I need to do something to make the system work.



Answer:

To implement an agentic AI system for creating toddler books, we can break the task into modular components. Here's the suggested code design and system:

Code Design
Input Module:

Accepts user input for the story theme, author name, and optional guidance (e.g., anecdotes, pictures).
Story Generation Module:

Generates 15 sentences (1-2 per page) based on the story theme using a language model like OpenAI's GPT.
Illustration Generation Module:

Creates illustrations for each page based on the story context using a generative AI model (e.g., DALL·E or Stable Diffusion).
Text Placement Module:

Places the generated text on each page in a kid-friendly font and layout.
EPUB Assembly Module:

Combines the pages into an EPUB format using libraries like ebooklib.
Cover Page Module:

Creates two cover pages:
Eye-catching cover with the title and author name.
Secondary cover with a warm background, main character illustration, and author/illustrator credits.
Output Module:

Exports the final EPUB file.
Suggested Code System
We'll create a Python project in the src folder with the following structure:

Implementation Plan
Install Required Libraries:

Install libraries like openai, Pillow, ebooklib, and reportlab for text and image handling.
Implement Each Module:

input_module.py: Handles user input.
story_generator.py: Uses GPT to generate story sentences.
illustration_generator.py: Calls an AI model to generate illustrations.
text_placer.py: Places text on images using Pillow.
epub_assembler.py: Assembles pages into an EPUB using ebooklib.
cover_creator.py: Creates the two cover pages.
Run the System:

Use main.py to orchestrate the modules and generate the book.
Additional Setup:

Ensure you have API keys for OpenAI and any image generation service.
Install required Python libraries using pip.
Would you like me to start implementing this system?



Created modules

Created main.py

Created __init__.py

Created input_module.py

Created story_generator.py

Created illustration_generator.py

Created text_placer.py

Created epub_assembler.py

Created cover_creator.py

The agentic AI system for creating toddler books has been implemented. Here's a summary of the created modules:

main.py: Orchestrates the entire process.
input_module.py: Handles user input for story theme, author name, and guidance.
story_generator.py: Generates story sentences using OpenAI's GPT.
illustration_generator.py: Creates placeholder illustrations for each page.
text_placer.py: Places text on illustrations.
epub_assembler.py: Assembles the pages and cover into an EPUB file.
cover_creator.py: Creates the main and secondary cover pages.
Next Steps
Install Required Libraries: Run the following command to install dependencies:

Set Up OpenAI API Key: Replace "your_openai_api_key" in story_generator.py with your actual OpenAI API key.

Run the System: Execute the main.py script to generate a toddler book:
